# Assessing Data 🔍
## What is data assessment?
In a perfect world, data would always be complete, accurate, current, pertinent, and unambiguous. In the real world, data is generally flawed on some or all of these dimensions. Data assessment in practice has tended to focus on completeness and accuracy, and that is the focus of this exercise.
## Analysis:
[x] Make a column description of all the given columns in the dataset.
[x] Understand how many rows and columns the dataset has.
[x] Make a quick analysis about null values, and datatypes and from which columns are those null values.
[x] How many unique values we have per column.
[x] Make summary statistics about the whole dataset.
